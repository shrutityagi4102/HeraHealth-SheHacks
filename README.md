# Hera Health SheHacks

Hera health aims at creating instantaneous disease prediction systems, to allow medical practitioners to intervene early and prevent diseases at an early stage
We want to create a standalone application that can be used from the comfort of one's own home to find out if they have any symptoms or if they have any doubts about a condition. We want to make predicting the most frequent diseases simple, economical, quick and effortless.
